This implementation describes an adaptive random search algorithm tailored to perform both exploration and exploitation. The algorithm starts with a randomly generated solution within given bounds and makes use of an adaptive step size to ensure it efficiently searches the solution space. A greedy acceptance criterion is employed to select better solutions, and the step size adjusts dynamically based on search progress. It is designed to minimize the number of function evaluations while searching for an optimal solution within the constraints of the given bounds.";;;bccf832a-f160-424b-b61d-eaa3e8f5b607;{}

In this updated version of the adaptive search algorithm, the following improvements have been made:

1. **Initialization with Evaluation**: The algorithm begins by evaluating an initial random solution to set a baseline for the best fitness and initializes it as the current best solution.

2. **Gaussian Perturbations**: A Gaussian distribution is used to create small perturbations in each dimension to explore the neighborhood of the current best solution.

3. **Dynamic Step Size Adjustments**: The algorithm dynamically adjusts the step size based on improvements. If an improvement is found, it reduces the step size to exploit the locality; otherwise, it increases the step size to explore further.

4. **Step Size Bounds**: The algorithm ensures that the step sizes do not become too small, maintaining a minimum exploratory capacity by enforcing a lower bound based on the scale of the search space.

These changes aim to improve exploration and exploitation balance, enhancing the optimizer's capability to seek an optimal solution effectively.";;;ff6f9526-298e-43c6-bdd0-eb348eb67c32;{}

This updated optimizer class `AdaptiveSearchOptimizer` has several improvements aimed at enhancing performance based on the provided feedback:

1. **Encapsulation in a Class**: The optimizer is now encapsulated in a class, making it modular and reusable for various functions and configurations.

2. **Evaluation Counting**: The `evaluate()` method ensures accurate counting of function evaluations every time `self.func()` is called.

3. **Dynamic Step Size**: The step size is adapted dynamically both when an improvement is found and when exploration is required. It introduces a minimum size for the exploratory capability.

4. **Adaptive Parameters**: The update rule for step sizes and its bounds account for both exploiting local improvements and exploring new areas efficiently.

5. **Initial Exploration Factor**: Initializes step sizes based on exploration needs defined by the differences (limits) of bounds, scaled with a configurable `exploration_factor`.

6. **Control Structure**: Logic for adjusting step size ensures a continuous balance between improving the current solution and searching broader parameter areas.

These changes aim to achieve better performance when faced with challenging optimization problems.";;;88632930-acaa-4680-aecc-dfe9742cc68b;{}

I've made these crucial changes:

2. **Encapsulation of Execution**: Wrapped the optimizer execution into a `run_optimizer()` function and called it within the `if __name__ == ""__main__"":` block to fix the `KeyError` related to `run`.

In this version, I've ensured that the function to execute the optimization process is named `run()`, which should be the expected method call to initiate the optimization based on your input. This should resolve any `KeyError('run')` issues by ensuring that the correct method exists and is used to perform the optimization process.";;;309d1cc5-72ea-4ae8-a689-4749183d4289;{}

In this updated version, I've replaced the method name `run()` with `optimize()` within the `MetaheuristicOptimizer` class. Make sure to call `optimize()` instead of `run()` to start the optimization process. This should resolve any `KeyError` issues related to calling a nonexistent method.";;;f9d23173-f9d3-45ed-b7c3-0a8953b9a9e2;{}

In this code, I've reverted the method name back to `run()`, which should address the `KeyError('run')`. Ensure you're calling the method `run()` when using the optimizer to avoid previous issues.";;;a875cc8e-f28d-44d8-9771-c3fb39f8ff53;{}
