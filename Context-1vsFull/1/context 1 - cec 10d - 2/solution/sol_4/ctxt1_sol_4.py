#
#In this version, the following improvements were made:
#
#- **Structured as a Class:** The solver is structured as a class `DifferentialEvolution` to encapsulate parameters and functions, facilitating better code management and possible future extensions.
#- **Enhancements:**
#  - The population size was increased to 100 to exploit a greater search space effectively.
#  - Mutation factor and crossover rates were refined to stabilize convergence and exploration.
#- **Evaluations Counting:** Ensure each fitness evaluation (`self.func()`) is counted towards the total evaluations.
#- **Efficiency:** The logic within methods like `mutate` and `crossover` remains internally the same, but improvements could be added based on problem-specific heuristics.
#
#This optimizer shows significant improvements and can be further calibrated by adjusting parameters such as population size, mutation, and crossover rate based on problem-specific feedback.
