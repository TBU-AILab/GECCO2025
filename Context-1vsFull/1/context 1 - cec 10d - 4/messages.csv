You are encouraged to be inventive and experiment with various strategies, including adapting existing algorithms or combining them to form new methodologies. Do not include any testing functions or statistical tests, as these are conducted externally. Ensure that you adhere strictly to the provided structure: method name and attributes are given.

### Improvements Made:
1. **Increased Particle Count**: The number of particles has been increased, which could help cover a wider search space, potentially leading to better solutions.

2. **Dynamic Inertia Weight**: The inertia weight is adjusted dynamically between 0.5 and 1.0. This aims to balance exploration and exploitation as particles stabilize during optimization.

3. **Cleaned Initialization**: Ensured that the `best_fitness` of each particle is initialized correctly, even before any movement.

These changes aim to enhance the performance across a broader set of objective functions by increasing the diversity of solutions and improving exploration and exploitation balance.";;;4c917954-8d83-4194-9e55-015a8aff7842;{}

### Key Improvements:
1. **Parameter Tuning**: I refined the parameter tuning by setting `cognitive_coef` and `social_coef` to 2.0 to reinforce the balance between individual exploration and team influence, aiming to stabilise and effectively utilize swarm intelligence.

2. **Dynamic Inertia Weight**: Fine-tuned the adaptation of inertia weight by decreasing its range for better fine-tuning, thus encouraging a steady transition from global to local search as iterations progress.

These enhancements aim to strengthen the optimizer's performance across functions where improvements were necessary, whilst consolidating gains from previous improvements on multiple functions as per the feedback stated.";;;93d5f5bb-876b-46a2-a689-3efe431b8b89;{}

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Inertia Weight Adaptation**: The inertia weight's range is more aggressively reduced `(0.7 to 0.2)`, favoring a quicker transition from exploration to exploitation as the process progresses.

2. **Coefficients Tuning**: The `cognitive_coef` is set to `1.5`, and `social_coef` is increased to `2.5` to emphasize both personal experience and swarm collaboration, enhancing balance and improvement opportunities.

3. **Particle Count**: Increased number of particles to `80` to widen the diversity of sampled solutions, increasing the likelihood of finding optimal or near-optimal solutions, particularly addressing shortcomings noted in specific functions.

These improvements aim to harness swarm dynamics more effectively to enhance solver performance across the trialed functions, aiming for reduced disparities with best-so-far solutions.";;;f8c79d5b-d54d-443e-a847-e52f4c0ef939;{}
