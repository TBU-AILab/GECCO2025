#Certainly! Let's further improve the algorithm by increasing the sophistication of its components. We can optimize the selection and mutation processes, enhance crossover operations with a more informed approach, and incorporate a dynamic feedback loop to adjust algorithm parameters based on observed performance. Here's an improved implementation:
#
import random
import math

def run(func, dim, bounds, max_evals):
    # Parameters
    population_size = 10
    elitism_rate = 0.2
    mutation_base_rate = 0.1
    tournament_size = 3
    evals = 0
    
    # Initialize the population
    population = []
    for _ in range(population_size):
        solution = [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]
        fitness = func(solution)
        evals += 1
        population.append((solution, fitness))
    
    # Sort initial population by fitness
    population.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    best_solution, best_fitness = population[0]

    # Simulated annealing parameters
    temperature = 1.0
    min_temperature = 0.001
    cooling_rate = 0.95

    # Functions for GA operations
    def crossover(parent1, parent2):
        beta = random.random()
        offspring = [beta * p1 + (1 - beta) * p2 for p1, p2 in zip(parent1, parent2)]
        return offspring

    def mutate(solution, improvement_factor):
        mutation_rate = mutation_base_rate * (1 - improvement_factor)
        return [
            min(max(sol + random.gauss(0, (bounds[i][1] - bounds[i][0]) * mutation_rate), bounds[i][0]), bounds[i][1])
            for i, sol in enumerate(solution)
        ]

    def tournament_selection(population):
        selected = random.sample(population, tournament_size)
        selected.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        return selected[0]

    while evals < max_evals:
        new_population = []

        # Elitism: retain a portion of best solutions
        n_elites = int(elitism_rate * population_size)
        elites = population[:n_elites]
        new_population.extend(elites)

        # Generate new individuals through crossover and mutation
        for _ in range(population_size - n_elites):
            parent1, _ = tournament_selection(population)
            parent2, _ = tournament_selection(population)
            
            offspring = crossover(parent1, parent2)

            # Calculate improvement_factor
            improvement_factor = (best_fitness - population[0][1]) / (best_fitness + population[0][1] + 1e-9)

            # Apply mutation
            offspring = mutate(offspring, improvement_factor)

            # Evaluate offspring
            fitness = func(offspring)
            evals += 1
            new_population.append((offspring, fitness))

            # Update the best solution
            if fitness < best_fitness:
                best_solution, best_fitness = offspring, fitness

        # Cool down the temperature
        temperature = max(temperature * cooling_rate, min_temperature)

        # Sort new population by fitness
        new_population.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        population = new_population

    return best_fitness
#
#### Key Enhancements:
#- **Variable Crossover**: Uses blend crossover with a dynamic ratio (`beta`) for creating offspring, promoting diversity.
#- **Adjusted Mutation Rate**: Now depends on an improvement factor, hence more variation is introduced when the search is stuck in local optima.
#- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Improved factor calculation for controlling mutation and updates based on relative improvements.
#- **Tournament Selection**: Increases selection pressure on better solutions by choosing the best from a subset of the population rather than a random pairing.
#
#These improvements are aimed at creating a more deep-diving search process that responds well to changes in performance and adapts its strategy dynamically to current search landscape conditions.
