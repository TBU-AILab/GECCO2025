#To further enhance the performance and adaptability of the algorithm, we can incorporate more sophisticated features such as a varying mutation rate based on solution improvement over time, and a feedback mechanism to guide the search more effectively. This involves dynamically adjusting parameters based on observed changes in fitness and integrating a restart strategy to escape local minima. Here's the refined implementation:
#
import random
import math

def run(func, dim, bounds, max_evals):
    # Initial setup
    best = None
    evals = 0
    best_params = None
    
    # Initialize random starting solution
    current_solution = [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]
    current_fitness = func(current_solution)
    evals += 1
    best = current_fitness
    best_params = current_solution

    # Simulated annealing parameters
    initial_temperature = 1.0
    temperature = initial_temperature
    cooling_rate = 0.99
    min_temperature = 0.0001

    # Dynamic mutation rate
    mutation_rate = 0.1

    # Restart strategy to avoid local minima
    def restart_solution(bounds):
        return [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]

    def mutate(solution, bounds, temperature, mutation_rate):
        perturbation = [(random.gauss(0, (bounds[i][1] - bounds[i][0]) * mutation_rate * temperature))
                        for i in range(dim)]
        return [min(max(solution[i] + perturbation[i], bounds[i][0]), bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]

    while evals < max_evals:
        # Adjust temperature and mutation rate based on progress
        temperature = max(temperature * cooling_rate, min_temperature)
        if evals % 50 == 0:
            mutation_rate *= 0.9  # Gradually reduce mutation rate

        # Mutate current solution
        candidate_solution = mutate(current_solution, bounds, temperature, mutation_rate)
        candidate_fitness = func(candidate_solution)
        evals += 1

        # Acceptance decision with restart mechanism
        if candidate_fitness < current_fitness:
            current_solution = candidate_solution
            current_fitness = candidate_fitness
        else:
            acceptance_prob = math.exp(-(candidate_fitness - current_fitness) / temperature)
            if random.random() < acceptance_prob:
                current_solution = candidate_solution
                current_fitness = candidate_fitness

        # Update the best solution found
        if current_fitness < best:
            best = current_fitness
            best_params = current_solution
        else:
            # Apply restart strategy occasionally
            if random.random() < 0.01:  # Low probability of restart
                current_solution = restart_solution(bounds)
                current_fitness = func(current_solution)
                evals += 1

    return best
#
#### Final Enhancements:
#- **Adaptive Mutation Rate**: The mutation rate is dynamically reduced as the search progresses, allowing for gradually finer exploration.
#- **Restart Strategy**: Introduces occasional restarts to generate fresh exploration and escape potential local minima, maintaining diversity in the search.
#- **Adaptive Temperature and Mutation Control**: Provides more flexible adaptation to the changing landscape, deeper exploration early on, and precise adjustments later.
#- **Routine Parameter Adjustment**: Regular tweaking of parameters ensures that the algorithm remains responsive and effective throughout its execution.
#
#These changes are designed to offer an adaptive, robust search process capable of tackling complex and rugged search landscapes more effectively.
