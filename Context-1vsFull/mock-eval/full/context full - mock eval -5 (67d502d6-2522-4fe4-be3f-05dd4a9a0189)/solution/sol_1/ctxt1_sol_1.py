#Sure, let's enhance the algorithm by integrating a hybrid strategy that combines elements of hill climbing and simulated annealing. This should help in efficiently exploring the search space while avoiding local minima. Hereâ€™s the improved algorithm:
#
import random
import math

def run(func, dim, bounds, max_evals):
    # Initialize variables
    best = None
    best_params = None
    evals = 0

    # Initialize a random solution
    current_solution = [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]
    current_fitness = func(current_solution)
    evals += 1
    best = current_fitness
    best_params = current_solution

    # Define a mutation function with cooling schedule
    def mutate(solution, bounds, temperature):
        new_solution = []
        for i in range(dim):
            perturbation = random.gauss(0, (bounds[i][1] - bounds[i][0]) * 0.1 * math.exp(-temperature))
            new_value = solution[i] + perturbation
            new_value = min(max(new_value, bounds[i][0]), bounds[i][1])
            new_solution.append(new_value)
        return new_solution

    temperature = 1.0

    while evals < max_evals:
        # Update temperature
        temperature = max(temperature - 1.0 / max_evals, 0.01)

        # Mutate the current solution
        candidate_solution = mutate(current_solution, bounds, temperature)
        candidate_fitness = func(candidate_solution)
        evals += 1

        # Determine if we should accept the new solution
        if candidate_fitness < current_fitness or random.random() < math.exp((current_fitness - candidate_fitness) / temperature):
            current_solution = candidate_solution
            current_fitness = candidate_fitness

            # Update the best found solution
            if candidate_fitness < best:
                best = candidate_fitness
                best_params = candidate_solution

    return best

#### Improvements Made:
#- **Simulated Annealing Elements**: Introduced a temperature-based acceptance criterion that allows for escape from local minima by occasionally accepting worse solutions.
#- **Gradient-like Exploration**: Perturbations are scaled using a Gaussian distribution whose influence diminishes as the temperature decreases, promoting fine-tuning as the algorithm progresses.
#- **Cooling Schedule**: Temperature decreases linearly, with a floor to prevent stagnation which helps balance exploration and exploitation over time.
