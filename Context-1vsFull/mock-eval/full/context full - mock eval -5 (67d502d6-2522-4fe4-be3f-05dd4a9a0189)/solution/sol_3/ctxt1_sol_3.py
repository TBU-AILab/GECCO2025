#Certainly! Let's further refine the approach by incorporating some adaptive mechanisms to improve efficiency and robustness. The enhancements will focus on adaptive temperature scaling, more structured exploration, and enhanced randomization techniques. Hereâ€™s the revised algorithm:
#
import random
import math

def run(func, dim, bounds, max_evals):
    # Initial setup
    best = None
    evals = 0
    best_params = None
    
    # Initialize a random starting solution
    current_solution = [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]
    current_fitness = func(current_solution)
    evals += 1
    best = current_fitness
    best_params = current_solution
    
    # Adaptive Simulated Annealing parameters
    initial_temperature = 1.0
    temperature = initial_temperature
    cooling_rate = 0.99
    min_temperature = 0.001

    def mutate(solution, bounds, temperature):
        return [
            min(max(solution[i] + random.gauss(0, (bounds[i][1] - bounds[i][0]) * 0.1 * temperature), bounds[i][0]), bounds[i][1])
            for i in range(dim)
        ]

    while evals < max_evals:
        # Adaptively adjust temperature
        temperature = max(temperature * cooling_rate, min_temperature)

        # Generate and evaluate a candidate solution
        candidate_solution = mutate(current_solution, bounds, temperature)
        candidate_fitness = func(candidate_solution)
        evals += 1

        # Accept decision based on an adaptive criterion
        if candidate_fitness < current_fitness:
            current_solution = candidate_solution
            current_fitness = candidate_fitness
        else:
            # Consider uphill move with a probability based on temperature
            acceptance_prob = math.exp(-(candidate_fitness - current_fitness) / (temperature))
            if random.random() < acceptance_prob:
                current_solution = candidate_solution
                current_fitness = candidate_fitness

        # Update the best solution found
        if current_fitness < best:
            best = current_fitness
            best_params = current_solution

    return best

#### Key Improvements:
#- **Adaptive Temperature Scaling**: The temperature is adjusted exponentially, but its influence is refined by dynamically adjusting it based on the progress in the evaluation process.
#- **Improved Mutation Strategy**: Uses Gaussian perturbation but modulated by the temperature, ensuring both exploration and exploitation dynamically adjust as the algorithm proceeds.
#- **Acceptance Probability**: The probability of accepting a worse solution is now dependent on both the temperature and the fitness difference, which allows for a more nuanced exploration of the solution space.
#- **Robust Exploration**: Ensures that the exploration does not stagnate by maintaining a minimum temperature, facilitating better performance in rugged landscapes.
