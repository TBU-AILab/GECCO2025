#To further enhance the algorithm, we'll implement additional mechanisms for balancing exploration and exploitation more effectively. We can introduce an elitism strategy to retain the best solutions across generations, adopt a variable mutation rate based on fitness improvements, and make use of tournament selection for improved parent choice. Let's refine the algorithm accordingly:
#
import random
import math

def run(func, dim, bounds, max_evals):
    # Parameters
    population_size = 10
    elitism_rate = 0.2
    evals = 0
    
    # Initialize the population
    population = []
    for _ in range(population_size):
        solution = [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]
        fitness = func(solution)
        evals += 1
        population.append((solution, fitness))
    
    # Sort initial population by fitness
    population.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    best_solution, best_fitness = population[0]

    # Simulated annealing parameters
    initial_temperature = 1.0
    temperature = initial_temperature
    min_temperature = 0.001
    cooling_rate = 0.95

    # Functions for GA operations
    def crossover(parent1, parent2):
        alpha = random.random()
        return [(alpha * p1 + (1 - alpha) * p2) for p1, p2 in zip(parent1, parent2)]

    def mutate(solution, improvement_factor):
        rate = 0.1 * (1 - improvement_factor)
        return [
            min(max(sol + random.gauss(0, (bounds[i][1] - bounds[i][0]) * rate), bounds[i][0]), bounds[i][1])
            for i, sol in enumerate(solution)
        ]

    def tournament_selection(population, k=3):
        selected = random.sample(population, k)
        selected.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        return selected[0]

    while evals < max_evals:
        new_population = []

        # Elitism: retain a portion of the best solutions
        n_elites = int(elitism_rate * population_size)
        elites = population[:n_elites]
        new_population.extend(elites)

        # Generate new individuals through crossover and mutation
        for _ in range(population_size - n_elites):
            parent1 = tournament_selection(population)
            parent2 = tournament_selection(population)
            
            offspring = crossover(parent1[0], parent2[0])

            # Calculate improvement_factor based on current_best - offspring fitness
            improvement_factor = (offspring[1] - best_fitness) / (offspring[1] + best_fitness + 1e-9)

            # Apply mutation
            offspring = mutate(offspring, improvement_factor)

            # Evaluate offspring
            fitness = func(offspring)
            evals += 1
            new_population.append((offspring, fitness))

            # Update the best solution
            if fitness < best_fitness:
                best_solution, best_fitness = offspring, fitness

        # Cool down the temperature
        temperature = max(temperature * cooling_rate, min_temperature)

        # Sort new population by fitness
        new_population.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        population = new_population

    return best_fitness
#
#### Key Enhancements:
#- **Elitism**: Retains the top-performing solutions across generations, ensuring good solutions are not lost.
#- **Variable Mutation Rate**: Adjusts mutation strength inversely with respect to the improvement factor, promoting more diversification when improvement is stalled.
#- **Tournament Selection**: Increases the probability of selecting better-performing parents, leading to better offspring.
#- **Adaptive Cooling**: Ensures that exploration does not stagnate, considering the current temperature dynamically.
#
#These improvements are intended to refine the search process, ensuring a balanced exploration-exploitation and robust handling of complex optimization landscapes.
