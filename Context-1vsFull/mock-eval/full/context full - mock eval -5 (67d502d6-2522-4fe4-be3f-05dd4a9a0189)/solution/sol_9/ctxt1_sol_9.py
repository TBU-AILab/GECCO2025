#To further refine the algorithm, let's incorporate differential evolution elements alongside our existing genetic algorithm approach. Differential Evolution (DE) introduces robust mutation and crossover strategies that can enhance solution diversity and convergence capabilities. This hybrid approach will maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation and offer a more flexible adaptation to varied problem landscapes.
#
#Here's an enhanced implementation:
#
import random
import math

def run(func, dim, bounds, max_evals):
    # Parameters
    population_size = 10
    elitism_rate = 0.2
    mutation_factor = 0.8  # Differential evolution mutation factor
    crossover_rate = 0.7   # Crossover rate for differential evolution
    evals = 0
    
    # Initialize the population
    population = []
    for _ in range(population_size):
        solution = [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]
        fitness = func(solution)
        evals += 1
        population.append((solution, fitness))
    
    # Sort initial population by fitness
    population.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    best_solution, best_fitness = population[0]

    # Functions for GA and DE operations
    def de_mutation(target_idx):
        candidates = list(range(population_size))
        candidates.remove(target_idx)
        a, b, c = random.sample(candidates, 3)
        mutant = [population[a][0][i] + mutation_factor * (population[b][0][i] - population[c][0][i])
                  for i in range(dim)]
        return [min(max(mutant[i], bounds[i][0]), bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]

    def de_crossover(target, mutant):
        return [mutant[i] if random.random() < crossover_rate else target[i] for i in range(dim)]

    while evals < max_evals:
        new_population = []

        # Elitism: retain a portion of the best solutions
        n_elites = int(elitism_rate * population_size)
        elites = population[:n_elites]
        new_population.extend(elites)

        # Generate new individuals using DE strategy
        for i in range(population_size - n_elites):
            target_solution, _ = population[i]
            mutant = de_mutation(i)
            trial = de_crossover(target_solution, mutant)
            
            # Evaluate trial solution
            trial_fitness = func(trial)
            evals += 1

            # Environmental selection
            if trial_fitness < population[i][1]:
                new_population.append((trial, trial_fitness))
            else:
                new_population.append(population[i])

            # Update the best solution found
            if trial_fitness < best_fitness:
                best_solution, best_fitness = trial, trial_fitness

        # Sort new population by fitness
        new_population.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        population = new_population

    return best_fitness
#
#### Key Enhancements:
#- **Differential Evolution (DE) Integration**: Introduces DE's robust mutation and crossover operation, helping to better explore solution space.
#- **Environmental Selection**: Ensures that only superior or equivalent performance solutions replace individuals, preserving adaptive learning.
#- **Crossover and Mutation Balancing**: Implements DE's probabilistic crossover alongside elitism to keep good candidates while still encouraging diversification.
#
#This approach enhances the algorithm's search by effectively focusing both on global exploration and local exploitation. It provides a robust framework capable of tackling a broader spectrum of optimization problems with varied complexities.
