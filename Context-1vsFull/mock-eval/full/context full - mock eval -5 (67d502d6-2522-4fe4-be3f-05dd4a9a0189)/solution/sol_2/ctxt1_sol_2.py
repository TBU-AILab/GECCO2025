#Certainly, let's refine the solution by enhancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off and ensuring more robust management of temperature and mutation rates. This will achieve a more balanced search process, allowing the algorithm to find better minima efficiently. Hereâ€™s the revised implementation:
#
import random
import math

def run(func, dim, bounds, max_evals):
    # Initial settings
    best = None
    best_params = None
    evals = 0

    # Initialize a random starting solution
    current_solution = [random.uniform(bounds[i][0], bounds[i][1]) for i in range(dim)]
    current_fitness = func(current_solution)
    evals += 1
    best = current_fitness
    best_params = current_solution

    # Set initial temperature for simulated annealing
    initial_temperature = 1.0
    temperature = initial_temperature

    def mutate(solution, bounds, temperature):
        return [
            min(max(solution[i] + random.gauss(0, (bounds[i][1] - bounds[i][0]) * 0.1 * temperature), bounds[i][0]), bounds[i][1])
            for i in range(dim)
        ]

    # Exponential decay schedule for the temperature
    cooling_rate = 0.995
    min_temperature = 0.01

    while evals < max_evals:
        # Cooling: Reduce the temperature
        temperature = max(temperature * cooling_rate, min_temperature)

        # Generate a mutated candidate solution
        candidate_solution = mutate(current_solution, bounds, temperature)
        candidate_fitness = func(candidate_solution)
        evals += 1

        # Probability to accept the new solution
        if candidate_fitness < current_fitness or random.random() < math.exp((current_fitness - candidate_fitness) / temperature):
            current_solution = candidate_solution
            current_fitness = candidate_fitness

            # Update the best found solution
            if candidate_fitness < best:
                best = candidate_fitness
                best_params = candidate_solution

    return best

#### Enhancements:
#- **Dynamic Mutation**: Perturbations are scaled based on the current temperature, allowing more aggressive exploration early and finer adjustments later.
#- **Exponential Cooling Schedule**: Implements an exponential decay for temperature reduction to stabilize changes gradually, which helps avoid premature convergence.
#- **Temperature Limits**: Ensures the temperature doesn't drop below a minimum threshold, allowing occasional acceptance of worse solutions to avoid local minima traps.
#- **Balanced Exploration and Exploitation**: The mutation function adapts its degree of change based on the current stage within the search, balancing between exploring new areas initially and exploiting known good areas later in the run.
