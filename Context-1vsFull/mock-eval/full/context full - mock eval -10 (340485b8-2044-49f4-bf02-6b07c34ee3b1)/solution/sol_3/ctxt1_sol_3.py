#In this further enhanced version, I've:
#1. Increased the particle count to improve search robustness.
#2. Implemented velocity clamping to prevent excessive movement, ensuring particles explore effectively without overshooting.
#3. Adjusted inertia, cognitive, and social weights dynamically, with inertia decreasing over iterations to shift from exploration to exploitation.
#4. Included adaptive temperature annealing for a slight random perturbation, driving exploration and avoiding stagnation in local minima.
#5. Ensured all particles remain within bounds to facilitate consistent and valid solution evaluations throughout.
