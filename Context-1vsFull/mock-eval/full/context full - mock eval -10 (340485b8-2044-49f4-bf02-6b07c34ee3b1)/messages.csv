This implementation combines elements of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing. Each particle adjusts its position based on its own experience, the best global solution, and a small random noise, emulating the effect of annealing temperature that decreases over time.

In this improved version, I have increased the number of particles for enhanced exploration of the search space. The inertia, cognitive, and social weights are combined with a temperature-dependent annealing noise that adapts over time, promoting both exploration and exploitation. Boundary handling ensures particles do not leave the feasible region by reflecting the velocity to zero when boundaries are hit, thus improving stability and convergence.";;;f044d189-30c9-4e47-b78b-e6c25e979ab3;{}

In this refined approach, I've made the following enhancements:
1. Increased the particle swarm size further to maximize search space coverage.
2. Implemented a linearly decaying inertia weight to shift emphasis from exploration to exploitation over time.
3. Introduced velocity clamping to maintain control over particle movement, assisting in fine-tuning exploration.
4. Integrated an optional neighborhood search mechanism that leverages local exploration for potential improvements, applied briefly until evals exceed max evaluations.
5. Adaptive temperature factor continues to introduce small-scale perturbation, aiding in escaping local optima.";;;664f30b9-975e-4f38-bf6d-357723c2ed1f;{}

### Enhancements Made:
1. **Dynamic Inertia**: Maintained linearly decreasing inertia to balance exploration and exploitation.
2. **Velocity Clamping**: Ensures that particles do not deviate too much, preserving the search within a realistic search space.
3. **Local Refinement with Gaussian Perturbation**: Introduces a new local search strategy using Gaussian noise, which adaptively decreases the search space over time.
4. **Boundary Control**: Adjusts particles back into bounds immediately after updating positions, ensuring no unintended boundary violations.

### Key Enhancements:
1. **Nonlinear Inertia Weight**: Utilizes a nonlinear reduction in inertia weight to maintain a strong exploration phase initially, then focusing on exploitation as the evaluations progress.
2. **Moderate Cognitive and Social Weights**: Tweaked these values to better balance individual discovery and group convergence.
3. **Periodic Reinitialization Mechanism**: Regularly resets a subset of particles to combat premature convergence and to maintain diversity within the swarm.";;;3bcd5bd1-fb35-44bd-99be-5099e872359a;{}

### Key Improvements:
1. **Adaptive Inertia Weight:** Continued use of nonlinear inertia reduction, which smoothly favours exploration initially and exploitation towards the end.
2. **Regular Reinitialization:** Strategically reinitiates a portion of particles based on the evaluation progression to prevent premature convergence and maintain diversity.
3. **Velocity and Position Handling:** Ensures that particles adhere to boundaries and movement constraints, supporting stable exploration of the solution space.
4. **Optimization of Parameters:** Carefully selected parameters balance the need for exploration and rapid convergence. The reinitialization strategy has been fine-tuned to run efficiently every 20% of total evaluations to refresh the search landscape.";;;8fc3f046-bc70-44b9-bb33-f3a38687a0be;{}
