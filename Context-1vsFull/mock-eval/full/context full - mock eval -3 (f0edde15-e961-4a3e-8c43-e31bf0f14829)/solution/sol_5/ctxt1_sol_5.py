#
#### Key Updates:
#- **Modular Methods**: Implemented `crossover` and `mutate` functions to streamline these operations and make the code clearer and more maintainable.
#- **Probability Adjustments**: Slightly increased mutation and crossover rates for potential exploratory improvements.
#- **Clear Handling**: Ensured all transformations from tuples to lists are explicitly handled to prevent any concatenation errors.
#
#These adjustments aim to make the algorithm more robust and adaptable to different optimization problems.
