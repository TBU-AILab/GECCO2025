#
#### Enhancements:
#- **Destructuring Improvements**: In `crossover`, reduced index manipulation errors by using `len(parent1)`.
#- **Consistency in Selection and Operations**: The use of `<=` ensures the selection process is stable and accounts for tied fitness values.
#- **Clear Data Handling**: Maintained consistent creation of new lists within `mutate` and `select_population` to ensure correct handling of mutable objects and prevent unintended side effects.
#
#These refinements should provide a more reliable and understandable code structure for handling optimization via evolutionary algorithms.
