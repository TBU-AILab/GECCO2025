#
#### Improvements Made:
#1. **Uniform Crossover**: Introduced a uniform crossover for potentially better exploration of the search space.
#   
#2. **Clear Handling**: Ensured conversions from tuples to lists after sorting.
#
#This enhances the algorithm's robustness and makes the evolutionary process potentially more effective in exploring the solution space.
