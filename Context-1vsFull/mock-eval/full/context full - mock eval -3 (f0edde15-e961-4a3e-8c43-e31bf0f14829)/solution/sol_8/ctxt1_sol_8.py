#Certainly! Let's refocus on ensuring each component is consistent and the code is robust, efficient, and error-free. I'll ensure that we're correctly managing lists and tuples and maintaining clear logic throughout.

#
#### Key Enhancements:
#- **Mutability Management**: The `mutate` function now creates a new copy of the individual, ensuring the original is not altered unexpectedly.
#- **Simplified Logic**: Reduced the crossover rate to ensure higher exploration, and adjusted mutation rate for appropriate variance.
#- **Representation Consistency**: The merging and indexing logic is streamlined, ensuring consistent handling of tuples and lists.
#
#These steps should improve stability and efficiency for the algorithm, helping it perform as expected without errors.
