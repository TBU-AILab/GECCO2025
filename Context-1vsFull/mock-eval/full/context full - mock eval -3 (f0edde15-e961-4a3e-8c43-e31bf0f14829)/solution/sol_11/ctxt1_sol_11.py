#Certainly, I will refine the solution further. Let's ensure proper handling of lists, correct offspring generation while avoiding exceeding population size, and overall clarity. Here is a cleaner and more efficient implementation:

            best_fitness = fitness[current_best_index]
            best_solution = population[current_best_index]

    return best_fitness

def tournament_selection(population, fitness, selection_size):

        child2 = parent2[:point] + parent1[point:]
        return child1, child2

#
#### Improvements:
#- **Refined Loop Logic**: Improved offspring creation loop to match the exact population size without using an excess check.
#- **Clear Data Handling**: Streamlined and ensured that all list operations are explicit, reducing room for error.
#- **Explicit Best Solution Tracking**: Updated index and solution tracking to minimize redundant calculations and improve clarity.
#
#This version aims to be robust, avoiding excessive generation and ensuring clear mutation and crossover processes, while keeping an efficient evolutionary framework.
