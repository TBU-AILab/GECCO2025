#
#### Improvement Highlights:
#- **Crossover and Mutation**: Now functions generate complete offspring lists while performing operations separately, ensuring the desired size of the new population.
#- **Consistent List Handling**: List transformations are explicitly managed, enhancing clarity and reducing potential type issues.
#- **Evaluation Counting**: Evaluations are counted consistently for tracking against `max_evals`.
#
#These changes should enhance the clarity and reliability of the code, ensuring it behaves correctly across different scenarios.
