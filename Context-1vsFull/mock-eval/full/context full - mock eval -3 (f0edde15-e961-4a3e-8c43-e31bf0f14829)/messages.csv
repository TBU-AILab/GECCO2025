You are encouraged to be inventive and experiment with various strategies, including adapting existing algorithms or combining them to form new methodologies. Do not include any testing functions or statistical tests, as these are conducted externally. Ensure that you adhere strictly to the provided structure: method name and attributes are given. Focus on developing the [Algorithm body] of the ""run"" method. Expand the search method with your novel approach, ensuring that every aspect of the algorithm's execution is geared towards effectively minimizing the objective function. Your innovative solution should be fully functional within this framework, without requiring external libraries. Here is the template you need to fill followed by an example.

### Improvements Made:
1. **Uniform Crossover**: Introduced a uniform crossover for potentially better exploration of the search space.
   
2. **Clear Handling**: Ensured conversions from tuples to lists after sorting.

This enhances the algorithm's robustness and makes the evolutionary process potentially more effective in exploring the solution space.";;;521c3a1b-df16-4ab9-b3ab-fba958d69e3b;{}

### Key Updates:
- **Modular Methods**: Implemented `crossover` and `mutate` functions to streamline these operations and make the code clearer and more maintainable.
- **Probability Adjustments**: Slightly increased mutation and crossover rates for potential exploratory improvements.
- **Clear Handling**: Ensured all transformations from tuples to lists are explicitly handled to prevent any concatenation errors.

These adjustments aim to make the algorithm more robust and adaptable to different optimization problems.";;;a3776bd5-048c-4bd2-a2da-73ef40562759;{}

- **Consistent List Handling**: List transformations are explicitly managed, enhancing clarity and reducing potential type issues.
- **Evaluation Counting**: Evaluations are counted consistently for tracking against `max_evals`.

### Key Enhancements:

### Improvements:
- **Refined Loop Logic**: Improved offspring creation loop to match the exact population size without using an excess check.
- **Clear Data Handling**: Streamlined and ensured that all list operations are explicit, reducing room for error.
- **Explicit Best Solution Tracking**: Updated index and solution tracking to minimize redundant calculations and improve clarity.

This version aims to be robust, avoiding excessive generation and ensuring clear mutation and crossover processes, while keeping an efficient evolutionary framework.";;;521ce7eb-b105-4538-ad2b-c17b5f5ba7ab;{}
