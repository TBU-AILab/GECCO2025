#Certainly! Let's further refine the algorithm to improve performance based on the feedback:
#
#- Make sure the solution handles boundary conditions robustly.
#- Enhance the population diversity strategies.
#- Keep the solution efficient in terms of evaluations and resource usage.

#
#### Explanation:
#
#1. **Periodic Diversity Injection**: New random solutions are introduced periodically, which helps maintain diversity throughout the optimization process without overly disrupting the population dynamics.
#
#2. **Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX)**: This crossover method is extended with a distribution index `eta` to control offspring variance and create diverse yet similar offspring to parents.
#
#3. **Efficient Population Management**: The algorithm ensures the new generation doesn't exceed the population size, also ensuring efficient mutation and crossover operations.
#
#4. **Adaptive Mutation and Crossover**: These adopting strategies ensure better search space exploration and exploitation.
#
#This refined version is designed to optimize performance while ensuring proper boundary handling and evaluation efficiency.
