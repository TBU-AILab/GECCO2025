#
#### Explanation:
#
#- The `crossover` and `mutate` functions now explicitly receive `bounds` as an argument, ensuring they have access to it within their scopes.
#- The overall structure remains unchanged to maintain the algorithm's design. This modification ensures that all instances where `bounds` is needed have explicit access to it, preventing any undefined variable errors.
