#To further enhance the solution based on continuous feedback, let's apply the following improvements:
#
#1. **Adaptive Strategy for Mutation and Crossover**: Implement a dynamic strategy that adjusts rates based on progress, encouraging exploration early and exploitation later.
#2. **Improved Diversity Management**: Ensure more strategic diversity injection, potentially using fitness variance to decide when to inject diverse solutions.
#3. **Consistent Boundary Checks**: Enhance clarity in boundary management with helper functions.
#   
#Here's the refined implementation:

        # Evaluate the population
        fitnesses = []

            if evals >= max_evals:
                break
            fitness = func(params)
            fitnesses.append((params, fitness))

#
#### Key Enhancements:
#
#1. **Dynamic Diversity Injection**: The algorithm now injects diversity based on the variance of fitness values, introducing new random solutions when the population becomes overly homogeneous.
#   
#2. **Consistency in Boundary Handling**: Simplified boundary clipping with a `clip_to_bounds` function ensures all variables stay within bounds easily.
#   
#3. **Strategic Variance Checking**: The algorithm checks if the population's fitness variance drops below a certain threshold, indicating the need for diversity to escape possible local minima.
#
#These improvements aim to make the optimizer more robust and adaptable across varying problem landscapes.
