You reply with python code only. Ensure all cost function evaluations (evals) are properly counted when self.func() is called. Return Python code that is complete and can be run without further modifications. Do not import any additional libraries or parts of them. Develop the code incrementally, ensuring each part is complete and functional before moving to the next step. Adhere to the latest Python practices and standards.

You are encouraged to be inventive and experiment with various strategies, including adapting existing algorithms or combining them to form new methodologies. Do not include any testing functions or statistical tests, as these are conducted externally. Ensure that you adhere strictly to the provided structure: method name and attributes are given. Focus on developing the [Algorithm body] of the ""run"" method. Expand the search method with your novel approach, ensuring that every aspect of the algorithm's execution is geared towards effectively minimizing the objective function. Your innovative solution should be fully functional within this framework, without requiring external libraries. Here is the template you need to fill followed by an example.
