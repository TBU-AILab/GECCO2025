I have added polynomial mutation to provide more diverse exploration of the solution space, which should help improve performance on more complex landscapes.

This updated code incorporates a differential evolution strategy, a potent technique for continuous optimization problems. By using mutation and crossover tailored to exploit population diversity through differential evolution, this approach facilitates effective exploration and exploitation of the search space. Here's how it works:

- **Mutation:** A vector differential mutation creates new candidate solutions by adding weighted differences between population members to existing solutions.
  
- **Crossover:** A trial vector is developed via binomial crossover between the original and mutant vectors, ensuring diversity and broader search space coverage.

This strategy is adept at dealing with various complex landscapes, which could provide more robust results across a range of test functions.";;;4a37a8fb-4a30-4256-9acc-abf264c4c1b7;{}

This improved version of the differential evolution-based algorithm introduces a dynamic adaptation for population size. The population size is set between a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 100, determined proportionally to the problem dimension. This aims to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation efficiency given the problem's scope. This approach allows the algorithm to explore more thoroughly in larger spaces while keeping computational resources in check for smaller dimensions.";;;ba2a3b6b-fcda-499f-9a91-4bc5df469a31;{}
